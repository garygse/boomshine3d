**Boomshine 3D**
============
Boomshine 3D is a small project that is designed to help introduce me to the world of creating 3D games using [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/). As the name of the project suggests, this is a 3D version of the a game called [Boomshine](http://www.k2xl.com/games/boomshine/) written by Danny Miller. The concept is addictively simple, and maybe re-creating it in 3D will destroy some of its appeal through simplicity, but as stated, this project is simply to get me used to UE4.

Installation
